What is Redux?
- A state management system for cross-component or app-wide state.

What is Cross-Component / App-Wide state management system
-Local State: State that belongs to a single component        -> useState() / useReducers()
-Cross-Component State: State that affect multiple components -> Requires prop chains
-App-Wide State: State that affect the entire app             -> Requires prop chains

React  vs Redux : (why not use React Context to deliver props)
- complex setup / hard to Management
- hard to use in high-frequency situations

concepts:
- Components ->(dispatch an action) -> Reducer Function ->(Mutates(=change))-> Stored Data(Central Data) ->(Subscription / subscribe)-> Components
- need to dispatch an action !

useSelector:
select the part of the state managed by the store.
