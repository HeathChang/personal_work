1. What is Routing?
: Only one initial HTML request & response. Page changes are then handled by CS code

2. :productId"  <- dynamic path
   <Route path="/product-detail/:productId">
   In this situation , productId becomes a Key of a value.
   Able to get data using params.productId

3. basically, prodcuts/:id, shows both products page and product-detail page at the same times
   use [ exact props] to hide products page
   use [switch] to active route that i want

4. Nested Route : using router in other components to load more component in the specific address
			<section>
				<h1>The Welcome Page</h1>
				<Route path="/welcome/new-user">
					<p>Welcome New User</p>
				</Route>
			</section>
