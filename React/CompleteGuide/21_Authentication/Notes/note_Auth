1. How does Authentication work ?
    - Session (Server side)
        : Once a server grants an access, the server stores a unique identifier on server for the client
        : Send back the identifier to client
        : Client send identifier along with request to protected resources
        : BUT, SPA served by server A  & BE served by server B, there is no tight coupling.
    - JWT-> Key difference with Server side Session
        : Server create permission token on server, send token to client.
        : Key: hashing data into a string
        : don't store the token but sent back to the client, and only the server knows how to create that token.
        : FE uses this token to attach it to future request. (can be validated by the server )
        : allows for de-coupling
