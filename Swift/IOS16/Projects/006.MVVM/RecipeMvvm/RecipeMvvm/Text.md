#  MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

MVVM stands for Model-View-ViewModel, which is an architectural design pattern commonly used in software development, particularly for building user interfaces. It promotes separation of concerns and helps in organizing code in a maintainable and testable manner.


## Model: The Model represents the data and business logic of the application. It encapsulates the data and provides methods and properties to manipulate and access that data. It is responsible for retrieving and updating data from various sources such as a database, network, or user input.

## View: The View represents the user interface components that are visible to the user. It could be a combination of UIKit or SwiftUI components such as buttons, labels, text fields, etc. The View is responsible for displaying the data from the ViewModel and forwarding user actions or input back to the ViewModel.

## ViewModel: The ViewModel acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It contains the presentation logic and holds the data that needs to be displayed in the View. The ViewModel exposes properties and methods that the View can bind to and interact with. It retrieves data from the Model and formats it in a way that is suitable for the View. It also handles user interactions and updates the Model accordingly.

### Key: independent of the View, which makes it easier to test the business logic without having to deal with UI components. The View, on the other hand, only focuses on presenting the data and forwarding user interactions to the ViewModel. This separation of concerns allows for better maintainability, reusability, and testability of the codebase.
